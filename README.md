# Travel Direct

A lightweight Minecraft mod that adds a dimension travel block - the End Anchor - which provides direct access to the End dimension.

## Purpose

This mod was designed specifically for skyblock and stoneblock modpacks where traditional stronghold generation is unavailable or impractical. It provides a simple, streamlined solution for End access without complicated mechanics.

## Usage

1. Craft the End Anchor
2. Place it in your world (cannot be placed in the Nether)
3. Right-click the End Anchor to teleport to the End
4. Use vanilla End portal to return to the Overworld

## Compatibility

- Built for Minecraft 1.21.1 using NeoForge
- Should be compatible with most mods
- Works great in modpacks, especially skyblock and stoneblock variants

## License

This project is available under the MIT License.

## Future Plans

While currently focused on End access, future versions may include travel options for other dimensions including modded ones.
